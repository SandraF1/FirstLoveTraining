        Stretching over 20,000 kilometers across northern China, the Great Wall
        is an extraordinary feat of engineering and endurance. Originally built
        to protect Chinese states from invasions, construction began as early as
        the 7th century BCE, with various dynasties contributing to its
        expansion. The Wall is not a single, continuous structure but a network
        of walls, watchtowers, and fortresses, many of which were constructed
        using locally sourced materials such as earth, brick, and stone. Its
        strategic design demonstrates an acute understanding of topography and
        military defense. Today, the Great Wall stands as a symbol of China’s
        historical determination and remains one of the most visited and studied
        heritage sites in the world.
