        Nestled high in the Andes Mountains, Machu Picchu is one of the most
        iconic examples of Inca architecture and ingenuity. Constructed in the
        15th century, this ancient citadel remained hidden from the outside
        world until its rediscovery in 1911 by Hiram Bingham. The site is
        renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone construction, which uses
        precisely cut stones that fit together without mortar. Visitors are
        often amazed by the way the terraces, temples, and plazas seamlessly
        integrate with the steep, rugged landscape. Machu Picchu also holds
        significant cultural and spiritual importance for the indigenous people
        of Peru, symbolizing the ingenuity and resilience of the Inca
        civilization.
