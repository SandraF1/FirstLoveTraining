        Petra, often referred to as the “Rose City” because of the distinctive
        color of its rock formations, is an ancient city carved directly into
        sandstone cliffs. Established by the Nabataeans around the 4th century
        BCE, it served as a crucial trading hub linking the Arabian Peninsula
        with the Mediterranean. The city is famous for its elaborate façades,
        tombs, and temples, particularly Al-Khazneh, which exhibits a blend of
        Hellenistic and Eastern architectural influences. Petra’s sophisticated
        water management system, including aqueducts and cisterns, allowed the
        inhabitants to thrive in the arid desert environment. This UNESCO World
        Heritage Site continues to captivate historians, archaeologists, and
        travelers with its dramatic landscapes and architectural marvels.
